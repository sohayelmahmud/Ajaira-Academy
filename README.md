# Ajaira Academy 

A simple Python program that helps users practice addition skills by solving randomly generated problems involving two-digit numbers.
Built as a part of the Code in Place initiative.

### How it works:
- The program generates two random numbers between 10 and 99.
- It asks the user to solve the addition problem.
- It checks if the user's answer is correct.
- Keeps track of how many correct answers are given **in a row**.
- Ends when the user gets **3 correct answers consecutively**.

### Sample Output:

What is 55 + 11?

Your answer: 66

Correct! You've gotten 1 correct in a row.


### Features:
- Randomized math problems
- Feedback on wrong answers
- “3 in a row” streak tracking
- Console-based and beginner-friendly

### Language Used:
- Python 3
- `random` module

### Future Ideas:
- Add subtraction/multiplication
- Track score history
- Create a GUI version
